DirtSweeper. Canvas / Android Mashup.

This was originally going to be a simple Android game, but instead it became an excersize in JSON web services and the HTML5 Canvas tag.

We have a ball moving around the screen and every 125 frames we send its coordinates up to a server for playback

Come and see the games that have already been played here:

The server component for this project was written in CakePHP, MySQL and Javascript and can be found in the cake directory.

The interesting files in the cake directory are the following:

cake/app/config/schema.sql - database structure
cake/app/controllers/games_controller.php - manages adding/watching games
cake/app/views/games/index.ctp - display a list of games
cake/app/views/games/watch.ctp - how to watch a game, contains the canvas
cake/app/views/games/json/add_game.ctp - json response after adding a new game
cake/app/views/games/json/add_times.ctp - json response after adding times
cake/app/webroot/js/floorsweeper.js - main javascript file
